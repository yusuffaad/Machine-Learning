# Heart Disease Classification

## Description

This project uses machine-learning techniques to build a classification model to predict the presence of heart disease. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Installation

To run this notebook, please ensure you have Python installed and the required libraries. Follow the steps below:


Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Heart_Disease_Classification.ipynb

Run the cells sequentially to execute the code.

## Features

Data Preprocessing: No missing values in the data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes data distributions and relationships.

Model Training: Implements machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost and Logistic Regression tunning the parameters manually, with RandomisedSearchCV and GrdSearchCV.

Evaluation Metrics: Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, cross-validation and plots ROC curves.

Visualization: Includes feature importance and performance metrics visualization.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following libraries:

Python 3.12

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

xgboost

scikit-learn


## Results

The notebook evaluates model performance using various metrics and visualizes the results, including:

Confusion Matrix

ROC Curve and AUC

Classification Report
